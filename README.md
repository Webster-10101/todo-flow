# TodoFlow

A minimal, calm, sprint-focused to-do app inspired by Llama Life.

## What it does
- Create a short sprint list of tasks with minute estimates
- Drag-and-drop reorder
- Live projected finish time based on current time
- Run tasks sequentially with one active countdown
- Insert a +5 / +10 minute break between tasks
- Mark done, delete, or extend estimates (+5/+10) during the run
- Soft “latest finish” guardrail (default 18:00) with a gentle warning + “Trim to fit”
- Persists locally (localStorage)

## Run locally

```bash
cd /Users/Alistair/Coding/TodoFlow
npm install
npm run dev
```
